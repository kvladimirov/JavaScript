    title: 'JavaScript for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Programming',
    description: `True to the title, this book is a whimsical exploration of very basic programming
     concepts, but don’t let that fool you. Books for kids aren’t just for kids. If you have never
      touched code before, this is a good place to start, even if you’re all grown up. 
      Diving in the deep end before you learn how to swim can be a frustrating experience. 
      It’s better to start your practice with some easy wins.`,

    title: 'Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming',
    description: `This book is a work of art. It walks you through the essential concepts with a clear 
    roadmap using clear language. It’s masterfully composed and edited, and unlike most programming books, 
    it’s full of exercises for you to practice. If I were teaching the basics of programming in high school 
    or college, I would use this as a text book.`,
