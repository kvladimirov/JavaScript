    description: `The new Mercedes-Benz A 45 AMG is an ultra-high performance hot hatchback based on the regular A-Class.

It combines hatchback family car practicality with breath-taking performance, incredible levels of grip and running costs which are fairly low consider the speeds this car is capable of. It isn't cheap, though.

The A 45's chassis is shared with the Mercedes-Benz CLA 45 AMG, but where the former is a proper hot hatch with a rock-hard ride and a sportier-sounding exhaust, the significantly more expensive CLA is slightly quieter, slightly more comfortable and boasts a much bigger boot.

Engine and performance

With a maximum output of 355bhp and up to 450Nm of pulling power, the A 45 AMG’s 2.0-litre turbocharged engine is the most powerful series production four-cylinder powerplant in the world. Merc says the result is a 0 to 62mph acceleration time of 4.6 seconds while its top speed stands at 155 mph (electronically limited).

On the road it doesn’t feel quite that fast unless you use the launch control system, but it’s certainly an event. The noise is aggressive and the handling – thanks to four-wheel drive – is balanced and stable with a huge amount of grip.

Although this is a serious performance car, the A 45 AMG leads its segment in terms of fuel consumption, returning an official claimed average of 40.9mpg with CO2 emissions of 161g/km.

Driving modes

The 2.0-litre petrol engine is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with paddleshifts behind the steering wheel. There are three driving programmes – Controlled Efficiency, Sport as well as an ‘M’ setting that stands for ‘Momentary’.

In C and S mode the driver can activate the manual mode (M) without having to remove a hand from the steering wheel by pressing the "up" or "down" shift paddle once.

In Momentary M mode the driver can switch to manual gear-shifting in all of the automatic driving programmes with automatic up- and down-shifting. In "C" mode (Controlled Efficiency) the changes are less aggressive in order support a fuel-efficient and comfort-oriented driving style. The start/stop function is also active in "C" mode.

Interestingly, Merc has included race-car features on the gearbox such as a double-declutching function and RACE START for optimum acceleration.

There’s also a three-stage stability control function and that enables the driver to vary the dynamics of the A 45 AMG at the push of a button. The safety-oriented "ESP ON" mode offers more neutral handling characteristics but switch it off and things get more interesting. Merc says this is best for track work but if the driver wants more dynamic handling on the road there’s also a ‘Sport Handling’ setting to choose from.

Exterior and interior mods

The A 45 AMG’s front end features a twin-blade radiator grille while the rear gets a diffusor and trim insert in matt titanium grey. Two square, chrome-plated tailpipes add to the drama.

It also comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, extra bodykit, sports seats and a carbon fibre dash with sporty detailing. Typically, it offers sports suspension but buyers can go for the more dynamic AMG performance suspension. Other options include an AMG rear aerofoil, 19-inch alloys, an uprated performance exhaust system and red painted brake callipers. This new car enters the fray against a raft of very competitive rivals.

Facelift in 2015

The entire A-Class range was updated in September 2015 and there was a hike of 21bhp and 25Nm from the 2-litre turbocharged engine, bringing peak power to 376bhp and torque to 475Nm. That means a 0.4-second improvement in 0-62mph time. Fuel economy remains the same, at 40.9mpg.

    model: 'Focus',
    engine: '2.3',    
    description: `As an all-rounder few cars match the enduring appeal of the Ford Focus hatchback. There's a version for pretty much everyone – from the humble 1.0-litre Ecoboost to the brilliant 2.3-litre RS – and they're all good to drive.

Whether you’ve a young family and are looking for something inexpensive and safe to run, or you’re after a nimble and engaging hot hatch with a useful degree of practicality, chances are there’s a Focus to suit your needs. It’s no surprise it’s such a big seller.

Third-generation, five-doors only

The third iteration of Ford Focus was introduced in 2011 as a five-door hatchback and the separately-reviewed Estate. Gone from this generation are the slower-selling three-door hatch, the even less popular saloon and the unfancied Coupe-Cabriolet.

It’s a majorly competitive sector that the Focus competes in with virtually every manufacturer offering thoroughly competent alternatives: the Vauxhall Astra, Volkswagen Golf – along with its SEAT Leon and Skoda Octavia siblings – as well as the Honda Civic, Hyundai i30, Kia Ceed, Peugeot 308 and Renault Megane are just a few of the hatchbacks on the market giving Ford a headache.

Rarely does the Blue Oval rest upon its laurels, consequently this generation Focus has been regularly honed and improved upon to help maintain its appeal. Key to its appeal aren't just visual and in terms of value for money – the Focus has keen steering and a great gearchange (in manual form), so keen drivers will feel like this car has been designed for them.

Styling and quality overhaul in 2014

A significant facelift for the Focus was introduced in 2014 (although not for the slow-selling electrically-powered model) with a new bonnet, front wings, bumpers (the front one incorporating a slender new grille) and slimmer headlamps. At the back, LEDs feature in the reshaped lights and there’s a new tailgate design.

There’s a great deal to like here – it deserves its bestselling status

Climb inside and you’ll notice the cabin materials were upgraded too, with many models featuring an 8.0-inch touchscreen at the top of the dashboard for the multimedia system (Sync2 initially, then Sync3 from 2017). All versions benefited from new instruments and redesigned switchgear, giving a mild uplift in quality.

Further enhancements were also made to the Focus’s self-parking and active safety systems.

Wide range of engine options

The breadth of powertrain choices for the Ford Focus is extraordinary, with most of the petrols and all of the diesels featuring turbocharging for efficient performance.

EcoBoost – read turbo – petrols come in 1.0- and 1.5-litre guises for the mainstream Focus range, producing between 100hp and 182hp, yet with CO2 emissions of just 99g/km for the least-polluting version.

Diesel fans have a choice of 1.5- and 2.0-litre units, serving up between 95hp and 150hp and, unsurprisingly, represent the most efficient of the conventional powerplants for the Focus. In fuel-sipping Econetic form, the 1.5 TDCi Focus has a claimed average of 83.1mpg with emissions of 88g/km of CO2.

You can go even greener with the very slow-selling Focus Electric, which simply requires charging up to replenish its batteries, although the maximum range is limited to 100 miles before you’ll need to plug it in again. On the plus side, the car itself is emission-free.

Fast Ford legacy: Focus ST and RS



Ford has a proud history of offering high-performance versions of its regular family cars and this generation Focus is no different, offered in both hot ST and scorching RS forms.

Petrol (2.0-litre EcoBoost, 250hp) and diesel (2.0-litre TDCi, 185hp) versions of the Focus ST are offered, each with a racier bodykit and deeper front grille, with enhanced performance and handling. Those petrol versions can reach 154mph and scurry from 0-62mph in 6.5 seconds.

Introduced in 2016, the Focus RS is something else again, offering genuine performance-car slaying speed (165mph, 0-62mph in 4.7 seconds) from its 350hp, 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine. Four-wheel drive and clever electronics keep the car stable or allow it to be playful, depending on your requirements, but while the bodywork’s suitably pumped-up, it looks less outlandish than RSes of old.

Ford Focus RS Mountune: is it worth it?

If you want to add even more performance to your fast Ford, consider the £899 Mountune upgrade.

Packed with features

Ford’s Focus hatchback comes with a raft of technology to improve driver safety and ownership experience such as a blindspot indicator, self-parking function and autonomous emergency braking. Some of these features are available as options only while others, depending on the trim level you choose, are standard.

There are nine trim levels available from the entry-level Style that comes with air-con but no alloy wheels through to the performance RS flagship, with the luxurious Titanium models providing comfort for those seeking a more premium aura.`,

    description: `The original Nissan Qashqai has become a sales phenomenon for the car maker in the same way the iPhone is for Apple. As the first mass-market family crossover, it sparked a generation of imitators, from the Renault Kadjar and Volkswagen Tiguan, to the Kia Sportage and Ford Kuga.

It’s easy to see why buyers are hooked: this new vehicle type blends the low running costs of family hatchbacks with more rugged SUV looks and added practicality. The Qashqai car has quickly become a commercial success in the process: more than two million have rolled off the production line since launch in 2007.

Where a decade ago this pioneering family car had the market to itself, today there are more than 20 rival crossovers clamouring for your attention. It’s a fiercely competitive class with the Nissan Qashqai remaining a popular choice.

It was designed and developed in the UK, and is produced in the hundreds of thousands at Nissan's factory in Washington in the north east of England.

You’ll truly be buying British if you choose a Qashqai.

Better quality – outside and in

The latest Nissan Qashqai has attempted to address the quality gap between its classiest rivals: the 2017 facelift added smarter materials to the roomy cabin, as well as extra sound deadening and thicker windows to make sure the car cruises quietly, with less road and wind noise.

It largely works. We found the vehicle to be noticeably quieter than earlier iterations, although the most powerful 1.6 diesel can make a minor racket when worked hard. The petrol engines are much improved in this respect.

Nissan Qashqai 2017 review by Parkers

The cabin is well suited to the rigours of family life, with plenty of room front and rear. Higher-spec cars get the full-length panoramic glass roof, which provides a bright and airy interior; just watch out as it also nibbles into rear headroom.

Nissan Qashqai practicality

Interior storage space is taken care of by a large central storage box between the front seats, while there are numerous cubbies and compartments to store keys, wallets and mobile phones. To make room for this, the Qashqai uses an electronic parking brake switch rather than a conventional handbrake lever.

One slight niggle is that over-the-shoulder visibility is still restricted by the large rear pillars, making checking the Qashqai’s blindspot tricky at times. Most models get a single or 360deg surround-vision parking camera to make up for it.

Nissan Qashqai 2017: boot and loadbay

Luggage volume stands at 430 litres (somewhat smaller than many rivals) and the boot floor has a clever trick up its sleeve: it’s made up of two panels, which can be repositioned to create either a deeper boot or a totally flat load area when the rear seats are folded down. There’s also space under the boot floor to stow the parcel shelf when not in use.

This time around there’s no seven-seater Nissan Qashqai +2 version – that model was replaced by the closely-related Nissan X-Trail.

Two petrol and two diesel engines

There are four engines available in the Nissan Qashqai range: a pair of petrols and a diesel duo, all turbocharged.

The two diesels, 1.5- and 1.6-litres respectively, are likely to make up the majority of sales in the UK. The 1.6-litre diesel is available with the choice of two- or all-wheel drive (AWD) and also has the option of a CVT automatic gearbox (the four-wheel drive version is manual only, though).

Nissan Qashqai review by Parkers

Most relevant for those looking to minimise running costs is the 1.5-litre diesel, with CO2 emissions rated at 99g/km (even on the biggest 19-inch alloy wheels) and a claimed fuel efficiency of 74.3mpg.

Fuel economy and CO2 emissions are attractive across the range as a whole, with even the largest petrol engine averaging a claimed 48.7mpg with CO2 emissions of 134g/km. These should be cheap cars to run for the average family.

The new Qashqai performs well on a road test. It’s very easy to drive with safe, assured handling and admirable ride comfort, which remains pliant even when specified with large alloy wheels (rims of between 16 and 19 inches are available). Numerous Qashqai accessories are available to tailor your car.`,

    description: `This is the third-generation SEAT Leon hatchback, based on the same underpinnings as the Volkswagen Golf, as well as the Audi A3 and Skoda Octavia. It comes with a firmer suspension arrangement to reinforce SEAT’s sportier aspirations for its car.

As well as its in-house rivals, the Leon faces stiff competition from the omnipresent Ford Focus and Vauxhall Astra, as well as the likes of the Honda Civic, Hyundai i30, Kia Ceed and Peugeot 308 among many others in this fiercely-fought segment.

Mid-life Leon refresh for 2017

SEAT made the front of the car a little bolder for 2017 with a remodelled bumper and grille, plus revised LED headlights, foglamps and indicators.

Inside the old multimedia system was replaced by an improved unit, with a 5.0- or 8.0-inch screen depending on the trim level. The larger device saw its button count fall to just two, forcing drivers to prod the screen or use the voice control functions to change settings.

The rest of the centre console was shuffled around and an electronic parking brake added, freeing up space for a larger cubby and optional wireless charging pad.

Safety kit that debuted on the SEAT Ateca SUV/Crossover was added, too, including Traffic Jam Assist, Pedestrian Protection System, Traffic Sign Recognition, Blind Spot Detection, and parking assist.

The engine range was also updated – a more powerful version of the 1.6-litre TDI diesel was added and a 115hp 1.0-litre TSI petrol unit that had previously been available in Europe made its way to the UK. Furthermore, a new upmarket Xcellence Technology trim was added at the top of the range.



The most powerful Cupra sports models, meanwhile, gained additional power – rising to 300hp – providing rapid acceleration.

SEAT Leon engine line-up

Taking full advantage of the VW Group’s cache of engines, the SEAT Leon boasts a wide range of petrol and diesel units.

The 1.0-litre TSI kicks off the six-strong turbocharged petrol range, supplemented by a 1.2-litre motor and a 1.4-litre in two states of tune, plus a 1.8-litre and the sportiest 2.0-litre Cupra versions.

There are three diesels, including the entry-level 1.6-litre and a 2.0-litre boasting two power outputs. The former comes with a five-speed manual gearbox, the larger engines have six gears, while all are available with an optional seven-speed DSG automatic.

SEAT Leon practicality

The third-generation Leon offers more practicality with a 39-litre larger boot, make a total luggage capacity of 380 litres. The wheelbase is also slightly longer to give more room for rear-seat passengers.

The SEAT Leon is also cheaper than many of its rivals, boasts plenty of standard equipment and comes with a range of fuel efficient, low CO2-emitting engines. Finance rates for the Leon also compare favourably against rivals, with low monthly payments on SEAT’s PCP offer.`,

    description: `Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but you would have to be a bit of a fan to believe the BMW 1 Series Sports Hatch is a good-looking hatchback.

In fact its long bonnet and rounded rear-end make it look as though it had been prodded a little with the ugly stick, but at its reward-biased stance is a visual clue to the range being predominantly rear-wheel drive – and unusual choice in this class.

This puts a clear emphasis on driving fun over outright practicality, giving it a distinct advantage over its core Germanic rivals – the Audi A3, Mercedes-Benz A-Class and higher-spec versions of the Volkswagen Golf, let alone more individualistic choices such as the Lexus CT, Infiniti Q30 and Volvo V40.

Unlike the first-generation 1 Series range that also featured Coupe and Convertible alternatives, those have been separated out into the BMW 2 Series range for the second iterations.

Comprehensive engine line-up

There's the ever-impressive line of efficient and clean turbocharged engines for the 1 Series that inevitably appear across the BMW and MINI ranges.

You’ll have to ignore the boot badges as if they match the capacity of the engine it’s more by accident than design – the excellent mid-range 120i and 120d have 2.0-litre motors, but then so do the 118d, 125i and 125d.

At the lower end of the range, three-cylinder 1.5-litre motors can be found in the 116d and 118i models while the high-performance M140i (there’s no M1 sister car to the M2 Coupe) utilises a six-cylinder 3.0-litre unit, capable of sprinting from a standstill to 62mph in 4.6 seconds.



Unlike other ranges in the BMW line-up, there are now plug-in hybrid versions of the 1 Series Sports Hatch, making the 116d EfficientDynamics the most efficient with claims of up to 83.1mpg and CO2 emissions of 89g/km.

Choose the 120d and you can also specify xDrive all-wheel drive. There’s a small efficiency penalty due to the extra weight of the system, but that extra traction makes it marginally quicker than the rear-wheel drive alternative.

High BMW 1 Series equipment levels

Long gone are the days when German-made premium-priced cars were well-engineered and poorly equipped. While the engineering legacy remains, there’s a wealth of standard kit on the 1 Series even if you plump for the entry-level SE.

Even here alloy wheels, climate control, keyless start and automatic wipers are part of the package. Most people tend to upgrade to Sport and M Sport, though, with M140i appearing as a standalone spec at the range’s pinnacle.



The trim offering was further bolstered in summer 2017 with the arrival of the M Sport Shadow Edition featuring darkened exterior elements to make it look a tad racier.

There’s a wealth of extras to choose from, many of which carry hefty price tags, so if you fancy a Harman/Kardon speaker upgrade or a Professional Navigation system expect to pay for the privilege.

BMW 1 Series facelift in 2015

Making the styling less divisive in 2015, the BMW 1 Series Sports Hatch received a mild mid-life facelift, with particularly emphasis on making the nose and tail look more like other models in the range.

The original triangular headlamps gave way to more horizontal units closer to the look of the 2 Series Coupe and Convertible, while the tail lights switched from being vertically orientated to being wider lenses bisected by the tailgate opening.

Interior tweaks were more restrained with detail changes to the dashboard and a range of new seat fabrics.`,

    description: `It’s testament to the remarkable talents of the Ford Fiesta that despite this generation being launched back in 2008, it’s still the small hatchback to beat, whether you choose an economical diesel, a sprightly petrol or a sporty ST derivative.

Battling it out against an array of talented contenders such as the Hyundai i20, Kia Rio, Mazda 2, Peugeot 208, Renault Clio, SEAT Ibiza, Skoda Fabia, Suzuki Swift, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Polo, among many others, there’s a Fiesta to suit virtually every need and budget.

Mid-life refresh in 2012

After four years on the market, Ford gave the Fiesta a makeover. Despite being few in number, the changes made a significant visual impact, especially at the front, with a corporate hexagonal grille – with a whiff of Aston Martin about it – and tweaked lights front and rear; various models featured LEDs for the first time.

Inside, the SYNC voice-activated multimedia system made an appearance, along with Active City Stop – Ford’s autonomous emergency braking system designed to prevent low-speed accidents.

The Fiesta also became the first Ford car in Europe to feature MyKey, a system that allows parents of teenage drivers to limit both the car’s speed and the volume of its audio system. It’ll even mute the stereo if a driver’s seatbelt isn’t worn.

Each driver has a key which is programmed to tell the car to initiate or switch off various safety systems as required. This has the potential to not only keep younger drivers safe but to also prevent them from causing unnecessary noise pollution.

Vast choice of trim levels

Most Fiestas are available with three- or five-door bodies, each offering the same amount of passenger and boot volume. Compared with newer rivals, the Fiesta’s a little tight space-wise, particularly in the back, and the boot opening isn’t as wide or as low as many competitors, either.

Since 2008 there have been over 25 different Fiesta derivatives, including a plethora of limited editions, but the current range has been (slightly) consolidated to make it easier to choose the one best suited to you.

Presently the line-up comprises of Zetec, Zetec Colour Editions, Titanium, Titanium X, ST-Line, ST-Line Black and Red Editions, ST-1, ST-2, ST-3 and the ST200, the number reflecting its power output. Studio and Style trims were dropped in summer 2016 following the arrival of the smaller Ford Ka+.

All current models come with electric front windows and mirrors, a CD player, tinted glass, remote central locking and air-con.

Wide array of engines available

There’s a wide selection of petrol and diesel engines to pick from, many of which are turbocharged to boost efficiency as well as performance.

We’d recommend staying away from the sluggish 1.25-litre petrols – the 60hp version of which is the slowest in the range – and instead opt for one of the zesty three-cylinder 1.0-litre units, ideally in turbocharged EcoBoost form with between 100hp and 140hp.

If you cover long distances regularly, then one of the diesel-engined Fiestas may suit your needs better. All are turbocharged 1.5-litre motors, producing either 75hp or 95hp depending on the version chosen. There’s also an efficiency-focused Econetic option, boasting claims of 88.3mpg and CO2 emissions of just 82g/km.

Sporty Fiesta ST sates enthusiasts

The primary thing you need to know about the Ford Fiesta ST is that each variant is an absolute joy to drive. They’re fast, agile and best of all, a lot of fun to pilot.

Introduced in 2013, ST-1, ST-2 and ST-3 derivatives are powered by a 182hp 1.6-litre turbo engine, propelling the Fiesta up to 139mph and completing the 0-62mph dash in 6.9 seconds, yet it still returns a claimed 47.9mpg.

Fiesta STs are easy to spot compared with less-powerful models in the range thanks to a suitably aggressive bodykit, a rear wing and a deeper front grille finished with a black mesh insert.

Ford raised the stakes further in 2016 with the introduction of the Fiesta ST200 – as the number suggests, this range-topper packed 200hp, enough to reach 142mph.`,

Battling in the fiercely competitive lower-medium hatchback segment, the VW’s up against the collective might of the Ford Focus and the Vauxhall Astra primarily.

But this class also contains other talents such as the Honda Civic, Hyundai i30, Kia Cee’d, Mazda 3, Peugeot 308 and Renault Megane, as well as in-house rivals in the forms of the SEAT Leon and Skoda Octavia.

Those pricier Golfs will also find themselves being compared with their Audi A3 Sportback sister cars, as well as the BMW 1 Series, Infiniti Q30, Lexus CT and Mercedes-Benz A-Class.

Evolutionary Golf styling

Golfs have tended to be conservative choices and hence why the design bloodline is common to all seven iterations of the VW.

As per industry norms, this version’s larger than the model it replaced but it’s still a compact hatchback compared with many rivals thanks to its near-vertical tail.

That hasn’t hampered either cabin space or practicality, with one of the roomiest interiors in this segment, along with a 380-litre boot – that’s not the largest in this segment but the 60:40 split-folding rear seat does tumble flat for added flexibility.

If you need more space there’s always the pseudo-MPV Volkswagen Golf SV, or for all-out carrying ability in this family, the capacious Golf Estate.



Inside you’ll find the high-quality ambiance VW’s become acclaimed for with an exemplary level of fit and finish, with premium-grade squidgy plastics employed for the main planes of the dashboard.

Broad range of Golf powerplants

Boasting one of the widest line-ups of powerplant permutations, you’ll be struggling to not find a version of the VW Golf that satisfies your requirements.

Every petrol- and diesel-engined version is turbocharged for both power and efficiency and all feature Volkswagen’s BlueMotion fuel-saving measures, including stop-start.

Petrol engines start with a 1.0-litre, three-cylinder TSI with 115hp, while the rest of the mainstream range is fleshed out with four-cylinder TSIs of 1.2- (85hp) and 1.4-litre (125hp and 150hp) capacities, the larger one of which is also available with ACT – Active Cylinder Technology – to effectively shut off half the engine when it’s not needed.

What are your Volkswagen Golf GTI choices?



Both the Golf GTI and R performance versions feature 2.0-litre TSI turbo petrol engines producing between 220hp and 300hp depending upon the version chosen – good enough for a top speed of 155mph and a sub-5.0 second 0-62mph time for the quickest.

VW upped the ante even further with a stripped-out and strictly limited edition Golf GTI Clubsport S in 2016 boasting 310hp, and a top speed of 164mph.

For those seeking the efficiency of diesel power, the 1.6-litre TDI comes in 110hp form, while the 2.0-litre version is available in outputs of 150hp or 184hp if you opt for the sportier Golf GTD. Official fuel consumption claims rate the BlueMotion version at 83.1mpg.



If the ability to drive with electric propulsion is key, then there are two choices: the plug-in hybrid Golf GTE is a sportier take on the familiar theme while the e-Golf is a pure EV (electric vehicle) with no conventional engine at all – the claimed range is 118 miles between recharges.

Facelift from 2017

Spring 2017 saw the arrival of the mildly facelifted Golf hatchback range. Visually the alterations are limited to new bumpers and lights which employ a higher proportion of LED technology.

But, nonetheless VW is calling this the most significant mid-life update in the Golf’s 40-year history – which just goes to show the pace of change in the modern car industry.

As such, the facelift focuses largely on technology – in terms of both infotainment and safety. There’s a new 9.2-inch Discover Pro touchscreen option, for example, that together with the newly available Active Info Display fully-digital instrument cluster (VW’s version of Audi’s Virtual Cockpit) completely modernises the interior.

Discover Pro even features a rudimentary gesture control system that allows you to ‘swipe’ certain functions without touching anything at all.

Most of the engines carry over as before. However, VW has added a lower-powered 1.0-litre TSI turbo petrol with 85hp, and an impressive all-new 1.5-litre TSI Evo turbo petrol available with 130hp or 150hp that will arrive later in 2017.`,

It’s the saloon that rival manufacturers benchmark against, in terms of desirability, drivability and quality, among many other facets. And while some match or even surpass the BMW in certain areas, it remains at the pinnacle of excellence in this segment.

Should you ignore the alternatives in the shapes of the Audi A4 Saloon, Jaguar XE, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class to name but a few? Not at all, but the likelihood is you’ll keep coming back to the 3 Series because of its all-round abilities.

There’s not just the Saloon, either, with the ever-popular estate-bodied 3 Series Touring vying in the practicality stakes alongside the hatchback-bodied 3 Series Gran Turismo.

BMW 3 Series saloon

Plus, if you’re looking for something more lithe and slinky, the very closely related two-door 4 Series Coupe and Convertible (the replacements for previous generations of 3 Series Coupe and Convertible) are sold alongside the five-door 4 Series Gran Coupe.

Popular with private and business customers

Not only is the BMW 3 Series Saloon understandably high on the wish list for many private buyers, it’s also a sought-after company car.

Why? Well, if you are a business looking for a good motorway cruiser with a premium badge, excellent fuel economy and pin-sharp handling, then the five diesel models in particular prove to be great all-rounders.

Choose the fuel-miserly ways of the 320d EfficientDynamics and claimed diesel consumption is quoted at 72.4mpg.

The benchmark  compact exec for more than four decades

It’s not the most efficient of 3 Series, though – that honour goes to the plug-in petrol-electric hybrid 330e, quoted at 148.7mpg. The real-world figure, especially away from urban environments, won’t be that astonishing.

BMW hasn’t forgotten enthusiasts who prefer the purity of petrol engines, with four in the main line-up from the humble 318i to the boisterous 340i.

Most models have rear-wheel drive, but for those seeking the security of all-wheel drive then BMW 3 Series xDrive versions are worth hunting out.

BMW M3 has a legacy to live up to

Topping the 3 Series line-up in both price and performance terms is the latest BMW M3 Saloon, bearing a badge that’s become fabled in motoring enthusiast circles over the past three decades.

Turbocharging the M3’s six-cylinder 3.0-litre engine has liberated 431hp, elevated to 450hp if you plump for the sharper M3 Competition Package. Choose the latter with the M Double Clutch Transmission – a gearbox that behaves like an automatic – for an impressive 4.0-second 0-62mph time.

Premium quality and generous equipment levels

In days of yore, premium German saloons were sparsely equipped; the argument being that you were paying instead for the engineering excellence.

While that might have been true, it won’t wash with contemporary tech-savvy buyers, so whether you opt for an SE, Sport, M Sport or M Sport Shadow Edition 3 Series Saloon, you will find it bristling with equipment including LED lights front and rear, dual-zone climate control and sat-nav.

Where the 3 Series is starting to show its age – this sixth iteration was launched in 2012 – is with its interior. There’s no doubting it’s well-assembled, and the technology still feels current, but rivals have upped the ante in terms of quality.

Step into a 3 Series having spent time in an Audi A4 and you’d be forgiven for assuming there was a £10,000 price differential.`,

    description: `With a sharper-edged design and lightweight underpinnings, the seventh generation Vauxhall Astra hatchback range has a tough job on its hands with such an array of accomplished rivals in the compact family car market.

Chief among the British-built model’s challengers are the Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf, but with others such as the SEAT Leon and Peugeot 308 vying for attention, along with attractive long warranties and reliability records for the Hyundai i30 and Kia Ceed, the Astra is facing stiff competition.

On sale initially as a five-door hatchback, it was joined in early 2016 by the Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer estate, although there’s no official word as yet on a replacement for the coupe-bodied Vauxhall GTC, based on the previous-generation model.

Less weight, more space

Underneath the Astra’s crisp styling is a platform that is on average 200kg lighter than that of the previous-generation model. Combined with improved aerodynamics, the Vauxhall’s thirst for fuel is reduced too.



That inherent lightness also benefits the Astra’s agility, making it feel much more nimble both around town and on windier back roads. Revised suspension settings and a suite of electronic systems are designed to make the Vauxhall more enjoyable to drive than before.

Inside there’s more space for passengers than before, allowing four six-foot adults to sit comfortably, while there’s also been a revamp of the dashboard. The revised interior mimics that of the Corsa and Adam, employs higher quality plastics and is sensibly-zoned with buttons collectively located depending upon their functions.

Efficient range of engines

Whether petrol or diesel, almost the entire range of engines offered in the latest Vauxhall Astra are turbocharged, the exception being the 100hp 1.4-litre petrol which serves as an entry-level point for the range.

Turbocharged versions of that engine come in 125hp and 150hp power outputs and are popular with petrol-engined buyers. The more powerful of the two is claimed to reach 60mph from a standstill in 7.8 seconds yet still returns a quoted 51.4mpg.

Already familiar from the Corsa and Adam is the three-cylinder 1.0-litre motor generating 105hp, while the range is topped – at least unless a performance derivative arrives – by a 1.6-litre 200hp engine.

Diesel fans are offered a choice of three different versions of the 1.6-litre ‘Whisper’ CDTi unit in 110hp, 136hp and - with twin turbochargers - 160hp BiTurbo.

All are impressively quiet power plants but it’s the lowest-powered of the trio which offers the greatest efficiencies, with claims of 85.6mpg and CO2 emissions of just 88g/km.

Simplified range, generously equipped

Unusually for Vauxhall, the Astra range has been simplified, but there’s a host of features available normally associated with cars at a much higher price point.

This Astra was the first Vauxhall to be available with the firm’s OnStar telematics system, with a concierge service just a button press away. Want to know where the nearest coffee shop is? Ask the OnStar representative and your sat-nav will be automatically instructed to direct you there.



As befitting modern smartphone technology, the Astra is also available with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, making connecting your device even easier.

Particularly impressive at night are the IntelliLux LED matrix headlight with directional function when cornering and glare-free automatic main beam.`,

    description: `The Kia Rio is a competent supermini which performs reasonably well in every area. However, against class-leading rivals such as the Nissan Micra, Volkswagen Polo and even the outgoing Ford Fiesta, the Rio struggles to stand out.

It doesn’t have the sense of fun seen in the Micra, the quality and ride comfort of the Polo or the drive of the Fiesta, plus it’s not priced low enough to make up for any of these shortfalls.

However, for many drivers its long warranty, good equipment levels and useful practicality mean it will serve the purpose of getting from A to B perfectly well.

Good levels of standard equipment

One of the Rio’s strongest suits is the level of standard kit on all trim levels. Even base-spec 1 cars benefit from luxuries such as Bluetooth phone connectivity, air-con and hill-start assist.

The only real disappointment is that the advanced safety features, including autonomous emergency braking, aren’t standard across the entire range – potentially harming Euro NCAP safety scores for lower-spec cars.

Mixed bag of engines and gearboxes

Unlike the Kia’s easy to understand trim levels, the range of engines is significantly more confusing. There’s a choice of four petrols and two diesels, many of which have been largely carried over from the previous generation Rio.

The pick of the bunch is the 100hp 1.0-litre petrol, but even then it’s not class-leading thanks to dim-witted responses and a harsh top-end of the rev range.

Seven-year warranty

As with all Kias, the Rio benefits from a seven-year or 100,000-mile (whichever comes first) warranty, which is transferable between owners. This is the only area where the Rio really stands out from its rivals, yet should ensure excellent all-round reliability.`,

    description: `What happens if you combine a normal hatchback, an off-roader and a compact people carrier? According to one French car manufacturer you end up with the Peugeot 3008, a family car that aims to appeal to those looking for something different.

It's not a new formula, the Nissan Qashqai was the first successful 'crossover' as they've come to be known. The 3008 is perhaps not as stylish as the Nissan Qashqai, but it makes up for it with a more practical and family-friendly interior.

It has a large and versatile boot, a useful split tailgate with a bottom section that flips down like a pick-up plus plenty of passenger space in the back.

It's reassuring to drive too with well-weighted steering, a superb ride and strong engines, in particular the HDi diesels. Add in impressive levels of refinement plus a quality cabin and the 3008 makes plenty of sense.

Practical cabin

The Peugeot 3008 is a crossover that takes much of its influence from the people carrier sector and it shows in the practicality and flexibility of its cabin. From the split tailgate that allows easy access to the boot through to the large door pockets, you can tell the 3008 has been designed by people with kids and families to transport.

It’s not all rosy, however, as the glovebox is small and the lid to the armrest between the front seats opens the wrong way for the driver of a right-hand drive car.

Still, the boot is vast and the rear seats fold down easily to leave a very long, flat load area that makes the 3008 the perfect choice for DIY fans or anyone who regularly needs a big holdall for their chosen hobby or sport.

Poor entry-level gearbox

The 1.6-litre petrol engine that forms the entry point to the 3008 range is a good motor and has been jointly developed with BMW, so no surprises that it’s willing and decently quick.

However, this engine is hampered by a five-speed manual gearbox that feels decidedly antiquated next to the six-speed ’boxes used in the rest of the 3008 range. It has a slow-witted, recalcitrant shift action that leaves the driver much less inclined to use the gearbox unless absolutely necessary.

2014 facelift and updates

At the end of 2013 the Peugeot 3008 became a lot less awkward to look at thanks to a neat nose job. An altered grille and chrome fog light surrounds along with LED daytime running lights on the headlights give the car a much smarter appearance. The tail-lights have been tweaked too, with a different LED arrangement.

Equipment levels were also upgraded slightly, with Bluetooth and USB connectivity made standard across the range and a reversing camera added to the top Allure trim.

    description: `The British designed and built Toyota Avensis Touring Sports is the estate version of the Avensis Saloon. It’s a fairly straight-laced machine, which is obviously geared towards company car drivers, and takes its place in the market up against the likes of the Volkswagen Passat Estate, Ford Mondeo Estate and Mazda 6 Tourer.

We found it to be a worthy protagonist, but it’s a way from being a class-leader in such illustrious company. It’s comfortable enough over long distances, which is important to company car drivers, and it does appear to return decent fuel economy too. However, the interior lags behind recent attempts from the above manufacturers and while the Passat is more comfortable still, the Mondeo offers a better drive.

All-new look

You’ll spot a new Touring Sports because it’s had a redesign, which is to say the styling is far less derivative than before. It mirrors the smaller Auris Touring Sports in this sense, with a distinctive front end and LED elements in the headlights being the stand-out features.

The firm also claims advances in nearly every other area, from comfort to driving pleasure, and from running costs to the equipment offered on each trim level.

Big boot

It has a 543-litre boot and rear seats which fold down in a 60:40 configuration to unlock a total of 1,609 litres. For perspective, the Avensis beats most rivals in this respect, but still falls behind the five-star Volkswagen Passat Estate.

There are four levels of equipment, and two represent the fleet-focused nature of this car. They are: Active, Business Edition, Business Edition Plus and Excel. Check the Equipment section to find out what is included on each.

Should be safe and reliable

You’ve also got a huge amount of safety systems installed to keep you, your passengers, pedestrians and other motorists safe. The upshot is that Toyota expects a five-star Euro NCAP crash test rating. Take a look at the Safety section of this review for details.

Toyota’s impressive reliability record comes as standard too, which will attract some buyers on its own. You simply don’t expect a car like this to break, and that sentiment is reinforced by the fact that the firm offers a five-year/100,000-mile warranty on all of its cars.

So this is a safe, practical, comfortable and reliable estate car that is definitely worthy of making your shortlist. Read on for the full Toyota Avensis Touring Sports review to find out more.`,
