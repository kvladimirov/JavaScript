        HTML 5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on
        the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C) to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while
        keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by
        computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is
        intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2
        HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable
        implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available
        for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces
        (APIs) for complex web applications.[5] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also
        a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes
        features designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
